## About Me

I'm a software engineer with 8 years experience in a range of roles, stacks and companies. I've been a Fullstack Engineer, Frontend Engineer, Technical Lead and Engineering Manager working at startups, scaleups and established companies. 

My most recent role was Senior Frontend Engineer at Canva. I worked on the SEO Growth Engineering team and delivered authentication features on landing pages like the [PDF to PPT Converter](https://www.canva.com/features/pdf-to-ppt-converter/) page. I particularly enjoyed backend development and I'm looking for a backend role this time.

I led the Authentication and Authorisation team at Linktree for over a year, delivering security features to users and platform tools to engineers. For users, we delivered an OAuth page with multi-factor authentication for a single, secure authentication flow across web and mobile apps. For engineers, we built secure communication tools that teams used used to build and own their own services, replacing the current monolithic authentication process.

I've also worked at Damstra Technology. I was working at a startup called Velpic when Damstra Technology acquired us and I was the only engineer to come across. I was tasked with responsibilities previously shared by a team of ten people, including product management, infrastructure, feature development and customer support. I also built and led an engineering team for the first time in my three year career. Within a year, we had a healthy team of three engineers and stable product. Infrastructure was key to this success and I worked on a distributed email queue, Kinesis data streaming pipeline and Kubernetes cluster to improve reliability and developer experience.
