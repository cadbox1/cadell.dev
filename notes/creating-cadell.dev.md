    - inspiration for building the site
    - lots of positive comments on hn
    - free
    - branch deploys
      - mean you can make a change and share it on a live site
        - deploys are automatic
        - unlimited number of live sites
      - compared to traditional shared development environments
        - manual deploys
        - sharing is limited to the number of enviornments you've set up (and maintain)
      - they can do this because they focus on static sites
        - static sites are simple because they don't have servers
          - Apparently Containers and Kubernetes can do branch deploys on more complicated projects
            - hard to setup
            - May as well try it out with Netlify holding my hand
      - Other goodies
        - automatically detects how to build your project
        - CDN 
        - some backend options with functions
        - Netlify CMS
    - Results
      - awesome experience
      - only had to decide whether to use their DNS or not and I decided to
  - GatsbyJS
    - features
      - React component model
      - Lots of starter packs
      - works with lots of different CMS's and content sources
      - can optimise images as part of the build

      - franc.dev
      - dan abramov
      - used it once before
    - briefly looked at other React static site generators from StaticGen
      - next.js
        - not focused on static sites
      - react-static
        - less resources
        - read their introduction and I still don't understand their benefits
    - Results
      - started with basic starter
        - doesn't support markdown because its basic
          - should I switch starters?
            - converted the markdown to html in Typora just to get something finished for the night

                  - content is easy to follow and discover
                - cons
                  - looks terrible
            - self hosted
              - wordpress
                - cons 
                  - don't want to maintain a server for a site that could be static
              - Netlify + GatsbyJS
                - based on React
                - fun to play with Netlify's branch deploys
              - GitHub Pages with Jekyll and Markdown
                - easy
                - free
          - Self-hosting seems to be my preferred option. Static site generators make a lot of sense to me and the futue looks bright with tools like [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) which let you edit the content online. If you don't want to control and customise your site much and want more content following and discovery features then a hosted site might be better.
          - GatsbyJS vs GitHub pages
            - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is free and really easy
            - They both support markdown
            - But React is cool, right?
              - because
                - component model
                - css in JS
              - I'm very familiar with React's benefits but its probably not worth the extra effort over GitHub pages if my the pages are just in markdown in my opinion.
            - How can I get the best of Markdown and React?
              - I remebered [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) from [docz](https://www.docz.site/) and [Gatsby supports it](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/).
            - MDX would let me write a standard blog post in markdown and then include a React component anywhere inside it.
            - There were [two starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?c=Blog&c=MDX&v=2) to choose from and I chose [gatsby-starter-blog-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/hagnerd/gatsby-starter-blog-mdx/) because it was closer to the original [gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/).
  - writing
    - is hard!
    - write dot points first using markdown for all in vscode
    - can expand and collapse nested lists
    - tried to right in full the first time which was painful when still learning
  - Styling
    - Gatsby comes with typographyjs
    - Choosing a font is hard
      - I found a lot of free fonts are pretty average
      - lots of awesome fonts on websites are paid
      - did not like default gatsby fonts at all
      - preferred sans fonts
        - options
          - Open Sans
          - Lato
          - Source Sans Pro
          - IBM Plex Sans
          - Nunito
          - Helvetica (classic)
          - System font stack
            - This will vary from system to system which I wasn't happy with
          - paid
            - Avenir (like on [forestry.io](https://forestry.io/))
      - serif options
        - Georgia
      - recommend using a browser extension like font changer
    - Choosing a color
      - hsl(x, 100%, 60%) is a good start
    - reusing styles with css in js
      - still experimenting with this
      - put common styles in a style.js file as objects then using them inline
      - typographyjs has some utils which are interesting but I'm still getting used to it and vertical rhythm
        - I'll update this post as I learn more
