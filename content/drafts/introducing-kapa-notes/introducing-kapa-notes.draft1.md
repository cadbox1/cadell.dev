title: Introducing: Kapa Notes

Today, I came up with a name for a notes app I've been thinking about for a while now. I'd like to introduce you to [Kapa Notes](https://kapanotes.com).

Why do we need another notes app? I've been thinking about this question a lot and I think a better question is "Why do I write notes"? I write notes because I can't remember everything. I write my thoughts down so I can find them later and hopefully turn them into something useful. I don't think there's an app out there solves this problem well enough. Something is missing.

[I write lots of notes](https://cadell.dev/blog/i-write-notes) and I've been writing them for over a decade. I've tried lots of different strategies but one thing I've found to be really important is keeping a timeline. That means I have a page for almost every day and I record anything notable I did that day on that page. Completed a task? Write it down. Found a cool article? Write it down. Came up with an idea for a project I'm working on? Write it down. There's reasons I like this strategy:

1. It's easy to write because you don't get lost in "where should I write this?". Just write it under today.
1. It's easy to find recent ideas. Just flick through the last couple days.
1. It's easy to see what you did in the last week.

The first two points are straightforward enough but the third point might need some more explanation. Every week, on a Friday morning, I spend about an hour reviewing my week. I reflect on what I've done, what I haven't done and come up with some action points. Maybe I didn't practice writing as much as I would have liked. Did I spend that time on another project or did I procrastinate. Maybe I was tired all week and didn't get much done at all. Maybe I didn't get time to refine my idea for a project and can do that now. Whatever the outcome, reflecting on the week is well worth the effort for me.

So, "Why do we need another notes app?". Because no app has a timeline and I think it's really important.

- [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/)/[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - No, you have to manage it yourself.
- [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)/[Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) - No, they both have notes for today but you have to capture changes from other pages yourself.
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - No, there's history on each page but nothing across pages and it's read-only so you can't edit it to make it meaningful.

I currently manage a timeline in Dynalist but it's limited and tedious.

I think our perspective of notes needs to change. I'm writing notes because I can't remember everything, which means I'm effectively reading someone else's notes, my former self's. How do we read other people's ideas on the internet? Twitter, Instagram and Blogs. Both Twitter and Instagram organise your content on a timeline. You post updates that are stored in chronological order (newest to oldest) on your profile. This makes it easy for other people to see what you've been up to. You might even include a link to more information on that topic, like a Blog.

Blogs, or at least good blogs (not this one), organise content in two ways: chronologically and topically. The Recent Posts page is organised chronologically so you can see what the author has been up to recently, similar to Twitter and Instagram profiles. Then they further organise content topically with categories and/or tags so you can dive in deeper. I think this dual way of organising content is perfect for organising notes as well.

This is what I want to explore with Kapa notes. Write an idea for a project and it's captured on a timeline. Update the status of a project and it's captured on a timeline, with all the other status updates. Are you stoked you completed that task? Change the completed event on the timeline to say how stoked you are!

This is just the start. [Let me know](https://cadell.dev) if this sounds like something you're interested in and I'll keep you posted.
