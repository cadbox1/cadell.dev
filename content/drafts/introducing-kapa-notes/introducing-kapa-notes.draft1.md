title: Introducing: Kapa Notes

Today, I found a name for an app that I've been thinking about for a while; [Kapa Notes](https://kapanotes.com).

I [Write (Lots) of Notes](https://cadell.dev/blog/i-write-notes) and have done so for over a decade but I'm still not completely satisfied with any of the tools currently out there. I feel like there's something fundamentally missing and I want to explore that with Kapa.

I want something that makes it easy to capture notes. What do I mean by that?

1. I want to be able to write notes first and categorise them second.
1. I want to capture notes over time.
1. I want to capture notes across my devices.
1. I want to capture other people's notes, and allow them to capture mine.

Let's dive into each of these

## Write-First

I'm easily distracted. Sometimes I have an idea, open my phone and instantly forget it. Sometimes I make it into my notes, read something I wrote earlier then forget my idea. Other times I think "where should I write this?" instead of writing it. These are the problems I hope to solve with a write-first approach. I want a place where I can write my raw thoughts then refine and organise them later.

I think tools like [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) and [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) have got this right. They both have a concept of "Today's Notes" and I want something similar. I currently do this manually in [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) and you could do something similar in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) but it's such a fundamental concept that it has to be setup from the start.

## Notes Over Time

There are two main ways to organise notes - by topic or time (chronologically), and I think they're both equally important. Take blogs for example. Good blogs (not mine) are organised with categories and recent posts. This allows users to explore more recent work or dive into topics they're interested in.

Simple notes apps, like [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/), are just organised by topic. Each list represents a topic and all the items in that list are for that topic. There's no way to see when each item was added to the list and that's because these apps are targetting simple use cases for a single person where it's assumed they know the history of the list or don't care about it.

Notion is also organised by topic. Each page represents a topic but you can also see the history of each page. This is a good start but I don't think it goes far enough. The history is hard to read and you can't edit it to communicate something more meaningful. You can't see history across pages either. In the past I've setup a CHANGELOG page to link off to newly created Notion pages to enable better discoverability. I find this interesting because Notion has an emphasis on collaboration for businesses.

Instagram is organised chronologically, or at least semi-chronologically, and it makes discoverability really easy. Updates are listed semi-chronologically in a feed and chronologically on your profile and it's really easy to understand and browse. Twitter is the same. They also
