title: The Discoverability Problem with Digital Notes
date: "2022-07-12"

I've been taking notes for a long time. I've hand-written them, typed them, used multiple apps, and strategies but something still doesn't feel right. Something's missing.

I take notes because I can't remember everything and remembering things can be helpful. Digital notes sound like the perfect solution but I don't think we're quite there yet. Searching through digital notes is a game changer, but it's also required because recalling digital notes is completely different to hand-written notes. I can't remember anything I type yet hand-writing notes almost commits them to memory, so I rarely need to search through them.

That's why discoverability is the most important part of digital notes. If you can't find your notes then writing them is useless because you're not going to remember them. I actually think of it as reading through someone else's notes.

So how do company wikis like Notion do it? They don't. You have to announce every new page otherwise no one will find it. If a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, it won't make a sound. You can announce things in Slack and other chat apps and this works quite well for the people that see it. The problem is people seeing it. Slack is noisy so it's easy to miss things, particularly if you've taken time off. Are you going to read through all the noise to see if anything important was announced? One solution is to have an announcements page in Notion organised by date so people can quickly check if anything has changed. This can work well if people can be bothered doing it and fair enough because the process for sharing some knowledge is now Create Notion Page, Share Notion Page in relevant Slack channels, update Announcements page. That's pretty tedious but it can be worth it if you're working in a team environment that will benefit from shared knowledge.

The same problem exists in personal notes. It's more tedious because you can write a lot more personal notes and there seems to be less benefit, because we're writing for ourselves and surely we'll remember what we type (we don't).

Most notes apps are organised just like Notion, with pages. Each page captures a particular topic so they're organised topically. This also applies to outline-based apps like Workflowy and Dynalist where topics and subtopics are managed with nesting. The announcements page we talked about earlier is organised chronologically, by date.

You can manage your own announcements style page in any topically organised app and that's what I do in Dynalist. I do this because I like to have a record of what I did each day, so I can see what I did each week and so I can find what I'm working on at the moment.

LogSeq and RoamResearch organise both topically and chronologically yet they fail to solve this discoverability problem. They both have the concept of daily notes but this appears to be more focused on reducing the friction of writing. They're a place where you can quickly scribble down your thoughts rather than hunting for the right page to scribble them on. This is is a noble reason but it doesn't help with discoverability. Lots of people [insert references] still copy completed tasks to today.

I'm hoping that one day there will be an automated way to capture what I did each day.

Every notes app I've used misses this concept. Notes apps commonly organise notes with pages, as you might have seen in Notion, Obsidian, Google Keep and many, many more. The idea is each page captures a particular topic so this is what consider to be organising topically, or organising by topic.

The problem with organising topically is finding the topic. It's easy enough when you don't have many ongoing projects but at some point you won't be able to remember them all. The simple solution is to keep a list of active projects but you'll have to manage that yourself and it won't tell you what's _been_ active over the last month, quarter or year.

This problem also appears in a business setting with shared wiki's or knowledge bases. I like documenting processes because I like sharing knowledge with my teammates and creating places where they can share their updates. It usually goes something like create a Notion page, write some stuff down, post it in Slack to share it with my teammates, get their feedback and contributions and we're done. This works reasonably well at first but it isn't kind to new starters. They could look through Slack to find recent documents but Slack is often noisy, which creates friction and that's not what we want for new starters. One solution is to manage your own timeline or changelog page that has a table of with links to newly created pages or significantly updated pages alongside dates and a short description on why the page was created or updated. Something like "Use git merge instead of git rebase to update your branch because it's easier and we squash when we merge our PRs anyway".

The other problem with organising topically is finding a place to write. Which topic does my idea belong to? Where did I put that page? Is this half-baked idea even worth writing down? Before you know it, you've forgotten what you were going to write down.

One solution is to have a general page where you write down any little idea you have to reduce the friction of writing. This is a good idea but that page will quickly get messy so it's probably a good idea to organise your notes by day. You can write any little thought down here and it's easy to find again by looking through your notes for the last couple days. This is what I consider organising chronologically, or organising by time.

Organising chronologically makes it easy to discover recent content and reduces the friction of creating content in the first place. It's no surprise this is how social media is organised. Creating a new Tweet or Instagram post is always one click away and you can see what someone has been up to recently by looking at their profile because it's organised chronologically.

Apps like RoamResearch and LogSeq have embraced organising chronologically and they've been hugely popular because of it. They make it easy to write notes for today and you can browse through recent notes to find recent ideas. You can also reference topics in your notes from today which makes today's note visible under that topic's page as well so they have a blend of organising topically and chronologically.

I don't think they go far enough. The dated pages in Roam and LogSeq work like any other page or topic but I think they're more than that. For example, if you update a page or complete a task, that isn't reflected on today's page which hurts discoverability. If you care about discoverability then you might manually record your change on today's date which is tedious. There seems to be a disconnect and I think that's because the daily pages are more for half-baked ideas rather than enabling discoverability and so misses the benefits of organising chronologically. Imagine posting to a hashtag without it showing up on your profile. Maybe there's a case for it (I really wouldn't know, I don't use a lot of social media) but it shouldn't be the default.

Before social media we had Blogs. Good blogs (not this one) organise content both chronologically and topically. Every blog has a recent posts page and most have categories where you can see the recent posts for that category. This is what I think we should be modelling our notes after. We don't remember our typed notes so we should think about them as someone else's content and so we should be looking to social media to guide us.
