# Practicing Mindfulness

I started regularly practicing mindfulness in mid 2020, and found it far more interesting than I first thought I would. I originally planned to practice twice a day, Monday to Friday, for a week but that's turned into hundreds of hours over a few months and become an important hobby.

Each practice consists of:

- Meditation.
- Yoga.
- Walking.

And each practice teaches me about:

- Patience.
- Acceptance.
- Space.

Practicing these skills changes the way I think and that's been really positive for me.

I believe mindfulness is a personal experience so I'll explain how to practice first then talk about my experience later.

## First Practice
Allocate an hour but it will probably take less than that.
- Meditation
  - Lie on your back with your eyes closed. 
  - Set a timer for 10 minutes.
  - Stay lying down for slightly longer than you feel comfortable with. Aim for about 5 mins.
- Yoga
    - Half Sun Salute
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFkC5HLpfFY
        - Do about 3.
        - Aim for a gentle stretch.
    - Child's pose into Cobra
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerlEPvo5es
        - Do about 3.
        - Aim for a gentle stretch.
- Walking
    - Preferrably around nature.
    - Around 1-2km
    - Walk slowly.

There's not many instructions here and no guided mediation, that's because we're practicing `Patience` and that's best done with less instruction. There's no right or wrong way to do this practice, do whatever works for you.

I strongly recommend trying this first practice before reading further.

## Practice

This second practice is an extension of the first practice and is about bringing attention to your senses.

Allocate an hour but it will probably take less than that.

- Meditiation
    - Lie on the floor with your eyes closed.
    - Let your body settle for about a minute. Don't time it.
    - Gently start to notice your breath. Notice how air enters and leaves your body. Notice how your diaphram expands and collapses and what that feels like. Can you feel your breath affect any other parts of your body?
    - It's important to do this with patience and acceptance. If you find it difficult to notice your breath or your body then practice patience and accept that. Take a breath when you're ready and try again.
    - If you find your mind thinking about something else, that's fine. When you're ready, gently bring your attention back to your breath.
    - Your breath is a good sense to come back to throughought the practice.
    - As you lie on the floor, notice what the ground feels like underneath you. Is there more pressure in some parts than others? Have any sensations changed since you've been lying down? Slowly explore the sensations of your body, good or bad.
    - Again, bring your attention back to your breath at any time.
    - Allow your body to relax against the floor if it wants to.
    - Stay lying down for slightly longer than what feels comfortable.
- Yoga
    - Notice the sensations in your body as you stretch. Do the sensations change at all?
    - Go slow, especially the transitions between positions.
    - Bring your attention back to your breath at any time.
- Walking
    - Notice the weather, the trees, your surroundings or how your muscles feel during your walk.
    - Periodically bring your attention back to your breath.

Throughout each exercise we're bringing attention to our senses but doing so with patience and acceptance, slowly and gently. We also periodically bring attention back to our breath.

There's no right or wrong way to do this, just have a go. It's a personal experience.

I strongly recommend trying this second practice before reading further.

## First Week

The first week is all about doing more practice and more exploring. Explore your surroundings, yourself and everything in between and doing so with patience and acceptance.

- 2 / day, one in the morning then again at night.
- 5 days, Monday-Friday.

That's about 10 hours in total.

I think this is a good frequency to get started with because each session flows on from the last. 

If you found the previous 2 practices interesting, challenging or weird then I strongly recommend a week of practice before reading further.

## What is Mindfulness?

I didn't really know what I was getting myself into when I first started practicing. I just thought I would see if I could do a week then that turned into 2 and so on and so forth. 

I did a mindfulness course a few years ago but this was going to be different because it was unguided.

That turned out to be really positive because I could work things out for myself and that's why I recommend practicing before reading about my experience.

I learned mindfulness is about:

- Exploring your senses and surroundings.
- Practicing patience and acceptance.
- Making space and thinking openly.

Each practice is going to be different. Sometimes I find myself sinking into the floor as I meditate and other times I can't hear the birds through my thoughts. It's important to know that it doesn't really matter what happens because practice is about exploring with patience and acceptance rather than achieving an outcome. It's more about the journey than the destination.

This idea was so strange to me at first because it's very different to how I usually think.

My default is try and get as much out of my day as possible. That means a combination of fun and progress, short term and long term gain and I would try to improve and optimise to get more and more out of my day. I would race against time.

I think this mindset is pretty common, to varying degrees, and that might be because a lot of our society is based around consumption. It leads to questions like:

"Why would I waste my time with mindfulness when I could do something better?".

The short answer is: "Because you might discover something.".

The longer answer is: "The question doesn't make sense.". It's a critical thinking question to compare outcomes but mindfulness doesn't have a clear outcome because it isn't about outcomes. It's about exploring and thinking openly. Practice is pointless and that's the point. I learned that you don't need to fill your day with fun and productivty, you can just exist and explore what that feels like. You don't have to bring your phone to the toilet.

I still occasionally ask myself the same question but I get past it and get out there. I practice for the sake of practice or because I can; because I'm alive.

Technology has made media so available that you caneasily spend every spare minute you have consuming it and it's really addictive.

When you practice there's not much going on and there's no media to consume. You have a safe space all to yourself, without distractions, where you can reflect. It gives me a sense of perspective. You can't see the forest from the trees.

## My Experience

Earlier this year I was feeling pretty shit. I wasn't sleeping well, I was tired and I felt like I was failing all the time.

 I hated feeling like that so I was determined to fix it. I identified some issues, swallowed down that failure and went at them with more effort.

And I failed again, and again, and again.

After a while, I started to feel a bit hopeless. All my ideas failed to make an impact and I was now  too exhausted to try anything else. I was fried.

I started practicing a bit before this period and I remember practices where I felt a strong sense of space, peace and relaxation. But that wasn't happening anymore. Instead, all I heard was my loud, rapid thoughts. 

I sat in the park where, just a few days before, I admirred the beauty of the trees in the early morning sun but I just couldn't see that anymore. I just felt numb and that beautiful memory felt so far away; months instead of days. It was like I was physically inside a hole - I was in the same location but completely blind to my surroundings. 

I was acutely aware I was in that hole too I just had no idea how to get out or the energy to do it. I was stuck.

After a few days I started to feel a bit better. But it didn't last and I was soon right back into the same state a week later. Another failure and it felt like the worst one yet.

## Turning Point

At this point, Mindfulness was really frustrating. I was practicing for 10 hours a week and had nothing to show for it.

In hindight, I was very much still learning what mindfulness was all about. It's not about achieving something or feeling a particular way, it's about exploring yourself and your surroundings with patience and acceptance, whatever you find. At some point it occurred to me that I needed to accept how I was feeling instead of fighting it and embrace it instead of running from it.

This was my turning point. Bashing my head against problems was only digging myself a deeper hole, patience and acceptance were the way out. It's simple but simple doesn't mean easy. This whole time I was practicing behaviours that got me to this point and apparently I got pretty good at it! Learning how to change that behaviour was going to take time.

Doing anything when I was fried was ridiculously difficult but learning new skills like patience and acceptance was even more so. I needed to focus on prevention rather than recovery. After a few days I started to feel better again so I started practicing with a focus on patience and acceptance. And I continued to fail but I was also starting to understand.

I noticed that I could spiral out of control really quickly. One problem lead to another and they would avalanche on top of me. But I also noticed that there were warning signs in my practices. If my thoughts were racing or I was feeling antsy or agitated then that meant I was potentially carrying some stress. Even more so if it happened in consecutive practices. 

If I noticed warning signs then I tried to be more patient with myself and allocate more downtime and practice. It was really difficult because the warning signs can be subtle and you can't control everything that happens. I seemed to have bad weeks every second week and the lows never got any easier but each time it passed I started to feel a bit more hopeful.

I remember going out for dinner with friends and coming home feeling a bit down. I started going down my habitual path of "Why am I feeling down? What's wrong with me?" and I started to feel a bit upset. But then, all of a sudden, I felt a massive sense of joy and relief. I had just caught myself before a spiral and knew exactly what I needed to do about it. Be patient and accept it.

Lo and behold I eventually felt good for 2 weeks in a row for the first time in months.

I still occasionally have bad weeks and sometimes I don't handle them as well as I could but I'm ok with that I give myself the time and care I need to manage them when they do happen.

## Burnout and Stress

It's now clear to me that I was burnt out - my brain associated effort with failure, making everything seem incredibly difficult. Recovery takes time and means cycling through burnout symptoms like I did. It's commonly associated with long work hours but I now know that's not the case.

I won't describe what burnout is in this article but resources like [Emotional resiliene and burnout in leadership](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FfZ86PGA_uSFf425EzKXAmiFQLFBPqjqPN7iu1TZRw/edit?usp=sharing) from [resilient.wiki](https://resilient.wiki/) are a good place to start.

Stress is a much better indicator than work hours. I wasn't working long hours but I was certainly stressed and learned a lot about it, and my relationship with it, in the process.

I'm no stranger to stress and it's been a big part of my career so far. Why? Because it's productive and I like being productive. Unfortunately, it also has some downsides if left unchecked.



## Hindsight

- Why wasn't I feeling good anymore? 
  - I was stressed.
  - I was tired.
  - I was burnt out.
- Why was I tired?
  - I wasn't sleeping well.
  - I was stressed, which takes up energy.
  - I was burnt out, which makes everything seem hard.
- Why wasn't I sleeping well? 
  - I was stressed.
- Why was I stressed?
  - I pushed myself too hard by associating failures with my identity.
  - I was trying to fight my problems instead of understanding them.
  - I was impatient.
- Why did I feel like I was failing?
  - I was stressed, I couldn't stop thinking about my problems.
- Why was I burnt out?
  - My brain associated effort with failure.

Every time I failed I would push myself harder to do better next time. I didn't want to associate failure with my identity. It's hugely rewarding when you succeed but failure would send me into a loop.

Tiredness and stress are a bit like the chicken and the egg. I thought I was feeling stressed because I was tired, all I needed was a good night sleep. Of course, that failed because it's pretty hard to sleep when you're stressed out and that failure makes you more stressed, making you more tired and sending you deeper into a spiral. The only solution is acceptance which takes time, patience and practice.

I'm no stranger to stress and have found it to be really productive in the past because it blocks out distractions. It can give you tunnel vision. If I have a list of tasks that genuinely need to be done today I can work for hours on end without distraction or anything more than a toilet break. This can also be a major problem. I can go for a walk in the park and not see a single thing because I'm too busy thinking about something else. If you're too stressed out that tunnel vision can make it hard to see anyway out. It's isolating and self absorbing. I never thought about killing myself but I can see how this pattern could get you there.

Practicing doesn't help much if you're too far gone, it's simply too hard when you're very tired and stressed. It's too easy to skip practice under the idea that you're too busy or too tired or whatever. What I did was really try and tune in to how I was feeling every day so I could try and spot a warning sign before it avalanched. If I did I would try and practice more, give myself some more care and space and that seemed to help.

Of course, I also got that wrong a lot too. I distinctly remember feeling really shitty every 2nd week for 2 months and it was really frustrating. It did teach me about patience though. Towards the end of those months I worked out that I should accept and embrace feeling shit rather than running from it and making it worse. It wasn't easy and took some practice but it turned out to be a massive insight. I was still learning mindfulness while trying to work through whatever was going on.

Somewhere in that process I also realised that I was desperately missing some loved ones that had passed in the last year or so.

I remember going out for dinner with friends and it was a nice evening but I came home feeling really really down. I almost cried because I thought there must be something seriously wrong with me if I didn't enjoy that. But then I felt a rush of relief because I recognised the pattern and could give myself some more space to work through it.

After 2 months of cycles (but probably many more that I didn't notice) I actually felt good for 2 weeks in a row then again for a 3rd. Practicing was having an impact.

I still have periods where I feel really shitty and sometimes it's for almost no reason but that's ok. I accept that and will try and give it the time and care it needs. I also understand mindfulness a bit better now which helps.

In hindsight, I believe what I was going through was burnout - My brain had associated my actions with failure, making it hard for me to bring myself to do anything. I didn't recognise it earlier because of the state I was in. The only way through is to give yourself the time you need to understand it better. I couldn't have done that without practicing mindfulness. 

**Up to here 🙂**



Some weeks I was pretty down. I was tired, stressed, agitated and upset. I couldn't stop thinking, I couldn't bring my attention to my senses, I couldn't see the beautiful park I saw just a few days before. I knew where I wanted to be I just didn't know how to get there. I felt stuck. I felt like I was in a hole just taller than my head in a beautiful park but I just didn't know how to get out.

What I'd like to tell my former self is "you're not in a hole, you're in a park and you're feeling whatever you're feeling. you're scared and you're trying to get away from that feeling as quickly as possible. you're trying to reach a goal as quickly as possible and that mindset is why you feel the way you do. If you practice patience, take your time and explore how you're feeling you'll realise that there is no hole."


I found by giving myself space and practicing patience and acceptance I was able to explore even upsseting thoughts and when it gets too much I gently bring my attention back to my breath and back to my senses. I think that's allowed me to understand myself better as well.

I've thought about my grandparents who have passed and at times I felt like they were almost right there with me. 

That's hard to grasp when you think critically but it's understandable with enough practice.

I feel like practicing mindfulness is a bit different to other goals, for example, running. For that I would set a goal to go for a few runs and feel good when I hit that goal. I had the same approach with mindfulness originally but practicing mindfulness made me realise that goals don't really matter. Every day we're practicing and that's all that really matters. Achieving goals is just a bonus.

## Why does this help?

Practice involves:

- Pause
- Open
- Accept

Stress Cycle

- Stress
- Focus
- Fight

In moderation, this process can be very productive

In excess, you can get into a feedback loop where stress can 'Avalanche', leaving you tired and unable to appreciate or even realise your surroundings. It feels like you're standing in a hole and you're stuck - you know you're in a hole but you can't 'see' how to get out.

You can't 'see' how to get out because stress has given you tunnel vision.

Practicing mindfulness is the opposite, you practice thinking and observing openly and in doing so you experience a different perspective that can help you break out of this stress cycle or even prevent it.

After practicing for a while I've found that accepting my stress actually feels like the best way to manage it. I used to 'run' from it which only makes it worse.

Instead of solving a problem, you might accept the problem by realising it's no longer that important to you

I've also found these techniques have helped me with actually writing this article. Writing takes patience especially when you're not very good at it like me. I used to write a sentence then read it back, critisize it and rewrite it which just doesn't work. Now I just keep writing and eventually something good comes out and try and laugh at some of the dribble I put down. I now try and set aside 2 hours to write - 1 hour to get all the rubbish out and 1 hour to make some progress

## Time

When you explore your senses, your surroundings and your body you notice little details and I really appreciate them. (little details require space away from stimulus to notice).

When I explore these little details, it makes me think about time. Time delivers these details to me and you and everything in this world and I think that unites (connects?) us. When I practice I'm exploring how time interacts with me, and my surroundings. It makes me feel connected to the earth and everything in it and makes me feel nice and peaceful and means a lot to me. When you explore your connection to the earth it's easy to think openly and maybe even discover connections within yourself. Perhaps that's why mindfulness makes me feel like I understand myself a bit better.

I don't feel like we "spend our time" I feel like "time happens to us" or "time delivers the future". "time delivers details". It's like it's something external that's happening around you and you experience it differently depending on where you are. maybe you're experiencing time with a loved one or maybe you're experiencing time thinking about a loved one. or maybe you're experiencing time with your tv and couch.

I think this is what I've learned with loved ones passing I experienced time with them while they were alive and now that they've passed I will still experience time with them but just in a different way and reflecting on them during mindfulness is a great place to do that. When I think about it like that, they don't feel so far away. All I have to do is open myself up to experience that sensation and let time deliver it.

Reflecting on loved ones that have passed helps me better understand and appreciate my connections to the people around me that are still alive.

We experience time because we're alive. if it's something external then it could be similar to how some people think about god. [that talk by the author of eat pray love is also relevant here.]

It's nice to think that when you're lying still on the ground you're still moving through time. explore what that feels like. What sensations does time deliver to you? Are you moving through time or is time moving around you?

This is a really trippy thought. Even if you don't resonate with what I'm saying I still think it's interesting that I come up with something as bizarre as this. Maybe you'll make a crazy discovery (thought?) of your own. This sounds like something someone would come up with on magic mushrooms but all I did was walk around my park and lie on the floor. 

Maybe changing your perception of time is fundamental to mindfulness.

Taking that idea further, goals are just a product of a good journey.

There's almost something spiritual about it.

## Do what works for you

Part of the practice is about giving yourself time and space so it's important to do whatever works for you.

I found the 3 parts work well together and are equally important for me.

### Ideas

  - [90-90 stretch](https://youtu.be/8p6FtlqpAYg?t=184).
  - [Shoulder rolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVXK4DUoSj8).
  - [Full Sun Salute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73sjOu0g58M).

I do a few exercises before meditation while lying down. I roll my back, stretch my groins and do some hip thrusts and glute bridges.

Separate to practicing, I've also started having cold showers (at the end of my warm shower).

You can practice mindfulness during almost any activity like making tea for example or even eating things like nuts.

Don't take your phone to the toilet.



## Other Good Things
- Spending some time alone.
- Spending time away from technology.
- Consuming less.
- Stretching is really for your body, particularly your lower back. the Hip excercises really help me. I've also found some strength training like squats help too.
- Walking is good for your lower back.
- Being around nature is meant to be relaxing.
- Slow morning routines.
