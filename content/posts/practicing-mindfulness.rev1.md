# Practicing Mindfulness

I started regularly practicing mindfulness 10 weeks ago, on the 27th of July 2020, and found it far more interesting than I thought I would. I originally planned to practice twice a day, Monday to Friday, for a week but that's turned into over 100 hours now and become an important hobby.

Each practice consists of:

- Meditation.
- Yoga.
- Walking.

And each practice teaches me about:

- Patience.
- Acceptance.
- Space.

Practicing these skills changes the way I think and that's been really positive for me.

I believe mindfulness is a personal experience so I'll explain how to practice first then talk about my experience later.

## First Practice
Allocate an hour but it will probably take less than that.
- Meditation
  - Lie on your back with your eyes closed. 
  - Set a timer for 10 minutes.
  - Stay lying down for slightly longer than you feel comfortable with. Aim for about 5 mins.
- Yoga
    - Half Sun Salute
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFkC5HLpfFY
        - Do about 3.
        - Aim for a gentle stretch.
    - Child's pose into Cobra
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerlEPvo5es
        - Do about 3.
        - Aim for a gentle stretch.
- Walking
    - Preferrably around nature.
    - Around 1-2km
    - Walk slowly.

There's not many instructions here and no guided mediation, that's because we're practicing `Patience` and that's best done with less instruction. There's no right or wrong way to do this practice, do whatever works for you.

I strongly recommend trying this first practice before reading further.

## Practice

This second practice is an extension of the first practice and is about bringing attention to your senses.

Allocate an hour but it will probably take less than that.

- Meditiation
    - Lie on the floor with your eyes closed.
    - Let your body settle for about a minute. Don't time it.
    - Gently start to notice your breath. Notice how air enters and leaves your body. Notice how your diaphram expands and collapses and what that feels like. Can you feel your breath affect any other parts of your body?
    - It's important to do this with patience and acceptance. If you find it difficult to notice your breath or your body then practice patience and accept that. Take a breath when you're ready and try again.
    - If you find your mind thinking about something else, that's fine. When you're ready, gently bring your attention back to your breath.
    - Your breath is a good sense to come back to throughought the practice.
    - As you lie on the floor, notice what the ground feels like underneath you. Is there more pressure in some parts than others? Have any sensations changed since you've been lying down? Slowly explore the sensations of your body, good or bad.
    - Again, bring your attention back to your breath at any time.
    - Allow your body to relax against the floor if it wants to.
    - Stay lying down for slightly longer than what feels comfortable.
- Yoga
    - Notice the sensations in your body as you stretch. Do the sensations change at all?
    - Go slow, especially the transitions between positions.
    - Bring your attention back to your breath at any time.
- Walking
    - Notice the weather, the trees, your surroundings or how your muscles feel during your walk.
    - Periodically bring your attention back to your breath.

Throughout each exercise we're bringing attention to our senses but doing so with patience and acceptance, slowly and gently. We also periodically bring attention back to our breath.

There's no right or wrong way to do this, just have a go. It's a personal experience.

I strongly recommend trying this second practice before reading further.

## First Week

The first week is all about doing more practice and more exploring. Explore your surroundings, yourself and everything in between and doing so with patience and acceptance.

- 2 / day, morning then again at night.
- 5 days, Monday-Friday.

That's about 10 hours in total.

I think this is a good frequency to get started with because each session flows on from the last. 

If you found the previous 2 practices interesting, challenging or weird then I strongly recommend a week of practice before reading further.

After practicing regularly for a while I found that practice was about:

- Exploring your senses and surroundings.
- Practicing patience and acceptance.
- Making space and thinking openly.

Before regularly practicing mindfulness, I used to try and get as much out of my day as possible. That usually meant a combination of fun and progress, short term and long term gain and I would try to improve and optimise things to get more and more out of my day. Time is almost an enemy.

I think mindfulness is completely opposite - time is your best friend.

Even when I read that now I find it hard to believe and I think that's because a lot of our society is based around consumption. 



"Why would I waste my time with mindfulness when I could do something better?".



I still occasionally ask myself this same question but the fact that I asked means I should practice because I need reminding.

Practicing mindfulness helped me through a difficult situation. I'd recently lost some loved ones and my career wasn't going as well as I would have liked. So I tried to improve things. I tried harder at my job and tried to have more fun but didn't see results for whatever reason. So I tried again and again until I felt pretty stressed out and generally unhappy. All I could think was "how can I get out of this situation as quickly as possible?". The solutions I'd come up with failed to have much of an impact and by this point I was tired and not sleeping well so I really struggled to bring myself to do anything. I felt stuck. I felt like I was losing and I didn't know how to win.

In hindsight this was probably burnout but at the time, in my state, I really couldn't identify it.



## Time

When you explore your senses, your surroundings and your body you notice little details and I really appreciate them. (little details require space away from stimulus to notice).

When I explore these little details, it makes me think about time. Time delivers these details to me and you and everything in this world and I think that unites (connects?) us. When I practice I'm exploring how time interacts with me, and my surroundings. It makes me feel connected to the earth and everything in it and makes me feel nice and peaceful and means a lot to me. When you explore your connection to the earth it's easy to think openly and maybe even discover connections within yourself. Perhaps that's why mindfulness makes me feel like I understand myself a bit better.

I don't feel like we "spend our time" I feel like "time happens to us" or "time delivers the future". "time delivers details". It's like it's something external that's happening around you and you experience it differently depending on where you are. maybe you're experiencing time with a loved one or maybe you're experiencing time thinking about a loved one. or maybe you're experiencing time with your tv and couch.

I think this is what I've learned with loved ones passing I experienced time with them while they were alive and now that they've passed I will still experience time with them but just in a different way and reflecting on them during mindfulness is a great place to do that. When I think about it like that, they don't feel so far away. All I have to do is open myself up to experience that sensation and let time deliver it.

Reflecting on loved ones that have passed helps me better understand and appreciate my connections to the people around me that are still alive.

We experience time because we're alive. if it's something external then it could be similar to how some people think about god. [that talk by the author of eat pray love is also relevant here.]

It's nice to think that when you're lying still on the ground you're still moving through time. explore what that feels like. What sensations does time deliver to you? Are you moving through time or is time moving around you?

This is a really trippy thought. Even if you don't resonate with what I'm saying I still think it's interesting that I come up with something as bizarre as this. Maybe you'll make a crazy discovery (thought?) of your own. This sounds like something someone would come up with on magic mushrooms but all I did was walk around my park and lie on the floor. 

Maybe changing your perception of time is fundamental to mindfulness.



## What's the Point?

"Why would I waste my time practicing mindfulness when I could do something better?".

It's actually quite hard to answer this question and I often ask myself the same thing.

- Does practicing mindfulness make me feel better? Yes. 
  - Is that the point? No.

Practicing mindfulness is about openly exploring yourself and your surroundings. 

It's not about feeling better or achieving something.

If you think critically, it's pointless because there isn't a clear goal but I think that's exactly why it's worth doing, so you can practice thinking openly.

Practice is pointless and that's the point - it's about the journey, not the destination. 

Taking that idea further, goals are just a product of a good journey.

[not sure where this next bit goes]

I find "pointless" things like lying on the floor or walking around a park to be incredibly rewarding in ways that I couldn't possibly have predicted. That's why I've decided to do more pointless things because my brain isn't very good at predicting the future and is easily fooled by things like Netflix and social media. 

Regularly practicing is how I remind myself.

[I think I need to make more of a distinction in my head between something being rewarding in the short term vs the long term.]

## More Method

1. Allocate time for practice.
2. Bring attention to your senses and surroundings.
3. Practice patience and acceptance.
4. With enough practice, I can feel a sense of 'space' that can feel peaceful and relaxing.
5. That space becomes a platform for you to think openly, and explore yourself and your surroundings.
6. Regularly bring attention back to your breath.
7. Practice regularly.

[I'm trying not to say this too early because I don't want the reader to be goal orientated]

[I tried to focus on a space for a while but found that was too goal orientated, it was more about patience]



Before practice I thought about goals.

- How can I get more hours out of the day
- How can I get more money

I now realise these goals are shallow and the journey towards goals is far more important. Achievements are just a byproduct. I want spend more of my time exploring. Exploring my surroundings, myself and all the details in between rather than glossing over them.

I used to think "How can I get the most of my time?" now I think "How can I waste my time on 'pointless' things and surprise myself". Time was the enemy before, something to cram my efforts into. Now it's a tool. I can spend time looking at a tree or lying on the ground and have some profound thoughts. I think this is what resonates with my in my octopus teacher.

Writing - It's not rubbish, it's a work in progress.





When I started practicing I was pretty stressed out. My job was stressful and I recently lost some loved ones but I didn't realise how stressed I was until after I started practicing. I couldn't see the forest for the trees.

Practice gives me a sense of space and I think that space and can be a platform to explore yourself and your surroundings.

When you explore with patience and acceptance you can think openly and laterally instead of critically.

Steps
1. Pause - have a go. allow yourself to open up.
2. Explore your senses with:
   1. Patience
   2. Acceptance

3. Explore yourself - reflect on

After a few practices I started to feel a sense of space and that sense of space eventually allowed me to better understand how I was feeling.


I found by giving myself space and practicing patience and acceptance I was able to explore even upsseting thoughts and when it gets too much I gently bring my attention back to my breath and back to my senses. I think that's allowed me to understand myself better as well.

I've thought about my grandparents who have passed and at times I felt like they were almost right there with me. 

That's hard to grasp when you think critically but it's understandable with enough practice.

I feel like practicing mindfulness is a bit different to other goals, for example, running. For that I would set a goal to go for a few runs and feel good when I hit that goal. I had the same approach with mindfulness originally but practicing mindfulness made me realise that goals don't really matter. Every day we're practicing and that's all that really matters. Achieving goals is just a bonus.









up to here

you get space by practicing mindfulness with patience and acceptance
that space will let you think openly 


## Concepts

- Patience.
- Space.
- Acceptance.
- (Open mind.)

Every now and then I consider skipping a practice because I can't see the point. But if you practice doing things that have no point and you might surprise yourself. I think it's a little trick your brain plays on you.


- With that new perspective I've been better able to understand how I become 'stuck' in stress and I think practicing mindfulness might be a good way to almost counteract stress. In short, you think openly and laterally instead of critically

## Why does this help?
Practice involves:
- Pause
- Open
- Accept

Stress Cycle
- Stress
- Focus
- Fight

In moderation, this process can be very productive

In excess, you can get into a feedback loop where stress can 'Avalanche', leaving you tired and unable to appreciate or even realise your surroundings. It feels like you're standing in a hole and you're stuck - you know you're in a hole but you can't 'see' how to get out.

You can't 'see' how to get out because stress has given you tunnel vision.

Practicing mindfulness is the opposite, you practice thinking and observing openly and in doing so you experience a different perspective that can help you break out of this stress cycle or even prevent it.

After practicing for a while I've found that accepting my stress actually feels like the best way to manage it. I used to 'run' from it which only makes it worse.

Instead of solving a problem, you might accept the problem by realising it's no longer that important to you

I've also found these techniques have helped me with actually writing this article. Writing takes patience especially when you're not very good at it like me. I used to write a sentence then read it back, critisize it and rewrite it which just doesn't work. Now I just keep writing and eventually something good comes out and try and laugh at some of the dribble I put down. I now try and set aside 2 hours to write - 1 hour to get all the rubbish out and 1 hour to make some progress











## Do what works for you

Part of the practice is about giving yourself time and space so it's important to do whatever works for you.

I found the 3 parts work well together and are important for me, especially the mediation.

### Ideas

  - [90-90 stretch](https://youtu.be/8p6FtlqpAYg?t=184) - Probably my favourite stretch for hips and lower back.
  - [Shoulder rolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVXK4DUoSj8)
  - [Full Sun Salute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73sjOu0g58M)

I do a few exercises before meditation while lying down. I roll my back, stretch my groins and do some hip thrusts and glute bridges.

Separate to practicing, I've also started having cold showers (at the end of my warm shower).

You can practice mindfulness during almost any activity like making tea for example or even eating things like nuts.

## Other Good Things
- Spending some time alone
- Spending time away from technology
- Consuming less
- Stretching is really for your body, particularly your lower back. the Hip excercises really help me. I've also found some strength training like squats help too
- Walking is good for your lower back
- Being around nature is meant to be relaxing 
- Slow morning routines

## Other Resources
- power of now

## Why I wrote this
I wrote this for myself. Some of the language used on other texts like power of now is difficult to read especially when you're already a bit stressed out.

I also don't like how some texts critisize critical thinking so I wanted to present my view on that. "Monkey mind".

## Conflict of interests
I have no financial interest in this topic that's part of the reason why I wrote this. You don't need to pay for any guided mediations or read any books to start practicing today.
