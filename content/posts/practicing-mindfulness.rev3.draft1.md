# Practicing Mindfulness

I started regularly practicing mindfulness in mid 2020, and found it far more interesting than I first thought I would. I originally planned to practice twice a day, Monday to Friday, for a week but that's turned into hundreds of hours over months and months and become an important part of my life.

Each practice consists of:

- Meditation.
- Yoga.
- Walking.

And each practice teaches me about:

- Patience.
- Acceptance.
- Space.

Practicing these skills has changed the way I think about things and that's been really positive for me. 

I believe mindfulness is a personal experience so I'll explain how to practice first then talk about my experience later.

## First Practice
Allocate an hour but it will probably take less than that.
- Meditation
  - Lie on your back with your eyes closed. 
  - Set a timer for 10 minutes.
  - Stay lying down for slightly longer than you feel comfortable with. Aim for about 5 mins.
- Yoga
    - Half Sun Salute
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFkC5HLpfFY
        - Do about 3.
        - Aim for a gentle stretch.
    - Child's pose into Cobra
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerlEPvo5es
        - Do about 3.
        - Aim for a gentle stretch.
- Walking
    - Preferably around nature.
    - Around 1-2km
    - Walk slowly.

There's not many instructions here and the meditation is unguided and that's because we're practicing patience and acceptance, and that's best done with fewer instructions. There's no right or wrong way to do it, we're simply making a space and doing so with patience and acceptance. Practicing is far more important than how you practice.

I strongly recommend trying this first practice before reading further.

## Second Practice

This second practice is similar to the first but we're also going to bring attention to our senses.

Allocate an hour but it will probably take less than that.

- Meditation
    - Lie on the floor with your eyes closed.
    - Let your body settle for about a minute or so.
    - Gently start to notice your breath. Notice how air enters and leaves your body. Notice how your diaphragm expands and collapses and what that feels like. Can you feel your breath affect any other parts of your body?
    - It's important to do this with patience and acceptance. If you find it difficult to notice your breath or your body then practice being patient and accept that. Continue to breathe.
    - If you find yourself thinking about something else then, when you're ready, gently bring your attention back to your breath. This is part of the practice and certainly not a problem.
    - As you lie on the floor, notice what the ground feels like underneath you. Is there more pressure in some parts more than others? Have any sensations changed since you've been lying down? Slowly explore the sensations in your body.
    - Again, bring your attention back to your breath at any time.
    - Allow your body to relax against the floor if it wants to.
    - Stay lying down for slightly longer than what feels comfortable.
- Yoga
    - Do the same exercises as the first practice.
    - Notice the sensations in your body as you stretch. Do they change at all?
    - Go slow, especially the transitions between positions.
    - Bring your attention back to your breath at any time.
- Walking
    - Notice the weather, the trees, your surroundings or how your muscles feel during your walk.
    - Periodically bring your attention back to your breath.

Throughout each exercise we're bringing attention to our senses but doing so with patience and acceptance, slowly and gently. We also periodically bring attention back to our breath.

There's no right or wrong way to do this; just practice, it's a personal experience.

I strongly recommend trying this second practice before reading further.

## First Week

The first week is about practicing regularly and exploring further. Explore your surroundings, yourself and everything in between and do so with patience and acceptance.

- 2 practices per day, one in the morning then again in the evening or at night.
- 5 days, Monday-Friday.

That's about 10 hours in total.

I think this is a good frequency to get started with because each session flows on from the last. 

If you found the previous 2 practices interesting, challenging or weird then I strongly recommend a week of practice before reading further.

## What is Mindfulness?

For me, Mindfulness is about exploring with patience and acceptance. Practice means giving yourself space to think openly about your senses, yourself and your surroundings and doing so with patience and acceptance. You can also bring mindfulness into almost any activity, like making a cup of tea for example.

I think of it as 3 parts:

- Making space to think openly.
- Exploring your senses, yourself and your surroundings.
- Practicing patience and acceptance.

I also believe that Mindfulness is a personal journey so it might mean something different to you. That's why I think it's important to practice first; this is just what I learned on my journey.

Mindfulness isn't about relaxing or feeling a particular way, the purpose of practice is to practice and each one is going to be different. Sometimes I found myself sinking into the floor during mediation while other other times I couldn't hear the birds in the park over my loud thoughts. It's important to know that it doesn't really matter what happens because practicing is about exploring with patience and acceptance rather than achieving a specific mindset. It's more of a journey than a destination.

This idea can be really challenging to grasp at first, it certainly was for me. I found myself looking for ways to get better at Mindfulness, to get more for my time and effort. This productivity mindset is comes naturally to me and I think it's pretty common, at least for people I know. Who wouldn't want to get as much out of their day as possible?

Mindfulness is pretty much the opposite of this mindset; you spend a long time exploring the little things for almost no reason. It's sounds pointless but that's almost the point; it's so weird and different that it can open you up to new ideas and change your perspective. That might be why I find it so positive. It's also another reason why it's important to practice before reading because it can be difficult to understand otherwise.

Giving yourself space is an important part of mindfulness. When you remove yourself away from screens and other stimulus, you can start noticing the quieter things in your life. Thoughts, feelings and sensations will naturally arise to fill the space you've created and I think that's a good thing as long as you explore them with patience and acceptance.

For example, a handful of times I've fallen into something I can only describe as some sort of trance while meditating. It's like my body has fallen asleep but I'm still awake and it feels like I've fallen through the floor and I can feel a lot all these little sensations in my body. When I come out of it, it feels like I've just got up from a nap, feeling refreshed. It's not a particularly enjoyable feeling but it's definitely weird and interesting.

I also often find myself thinking about my grandparents that have passed and sometimes that can be quite emotional. I've practice embracing those thoughts instead of shying away from them and I think practicing Mindfulness can create a safe environment to do that. If it gets too much, I gently bring my focus back to my breath. Then I practice patience and acceptance and continue to explore those thoughts and feelings when I'm ready. Being able to explore difficult thoughts like these has helped me understand them better and in the process understand myself better as well. More on this later.

Sometimes I've even felt like they've been right there with me as I walk around the park. That can be hard to understand from a critical perspective but after practicing Mindfulness for a while it's not as much of a stretch.

After a while of regular practice I started to feel content with things in my life and that brought about a strong sense of peace that I haven't really felt before. It's very different to how you feel when you achieve a goal or succeed at something; I wouldn't even say you feel happy. Time just falls away and you feel like you're free to explore all the little things forever. It's was such a strange feeling for me because I don't think I've ever felt it in such a strong way before. Happiness and success feel great but in comparison they're short-lived and fickle, it's only half of the equation. The other half is taking to the time to practice exploring and appreciating what's around you. I now strive to balance the two.

If you still find yourself reluctant to try Mindfulness then you might actually have the most to gain. A large part of our society is based around consumption and technology has made that even more prevalent. And it's addictive. So addictive that you can easily spend every spare minute consuming media. Sometimes you can't see the forest from the trees. You don't have to fill your day with activities, you can just exist and explore what that's like and you might discover something like I did.

## Some of My Thoughts

After practicing for a while you can start to notice more and more details during practices. One night I had some really deep thoughts about them.

I walked around the park at night and started noticing my surroundings; the sound of crickets to my left, then the rustle of tree leaves overhead then a warm breeze on my face. As I explored these sensations I started to think about Time and how it can deliver these sensations. It's kind of magical how you can do almost nothing and have something external deliver something to you. Even when you're lying still on the ground, you're still moving through time or even time is moving around you. Mindfulness is about exploring what that's like. It makes me think the phrase "spending time" seem a little silly because it's not ours to spend. It just happens; the only thing we decide is roughly where we'll be to experience it.

Time binds us all together. The same moment the breeze touches my face is the same moment my loved ones have to do whatever they like but it's also the same moment the trees have to shake their leaves. It's universal and connects everything together. I think this is a really nice thought and makes me feel content with what's around me. I wish them all the best with whatever they're doing.

When I practice Mindfulness I'm exploring all these details and that can make you feel connected to the earth and everything in it. There's an infinite amount of detail around us and we'll only ever begin to understand a tiny portion of that. I find it deeply peaceful, so much so that it gives me a strange sense of purpose. In the same way that you explore your surroundings, you can also explore and discover connections within yourself and leaves me feeling like I understand myself a bit better.

I think this also applies to loved ones passing. You've shared so many moments together and now that they've passed you'll still spend moments together, just in a different way. They've made such an impact on you that some part of them will always be with you. When I think about it like that they don't feel so far away and I've found practicing Mindfulness can be a nice way to explore that. At the very least, reflecting helps me appreciate the connections I still have with people around me.

If Time is something external then it could be similar to how some people think about god or even fate. These are probably the most spiritual thoughts I've ever had.

This sections is pretty out there and maybe even a bit trippy but I didn't take psychedelics; all I did was lie on the floor then walk around my park. Even if it doesn't resonate with you I still think it's interesting to see the kinds of thoughts you might have if you open yourself up to them. Maybe you'll explore some out there thoughts of your own.

## My Experience

Earlier this year I was feeling pretty shit. I wasn't sleeping well, I was tired and I felt like I was failing all the time.

 I hated feeling like that so I was determined to fix it. I identified some issues, swallowed down that failure and went at them with more effort.

And I failed again, and again, and again.

After a while, I started to feel a bit hopeless. All my ideas failed to make an impact and I was now  too exhausted to try anything else. I was fried.

I started practicing a bit before this period and I remember practices where I felt a strong sense of space, peace and relaxation. But that wasn't happening anymore. Instead, all I heard was my loud, rapid thoughts. 

I sat in the park where, just a few days before, I admired the beauty of the trees in the early morning sun but I just couldn't see that anymore. I just felt numb and that beautiful memory felt so far away; months instead of days. It was like I was physically inside a hole - I was in the same location but completely blind to my surroundings. 

I was acutely aware I was in that hole too I just had no idea how to get out or the energy to do it. I was stuck.

After a few days I started to feel a bit better. But it didn't last and I was soon right back into the same state a week later. Another failure and it felt like the worst one yet.

At this point, Mindfulness was really frustrating. I was practicing for 10 hours a week and had nothing to show for it.

In hindsight, I was very much still learning what mindfulness was all about. It's not about achieving something or feeling a particular way, it's about exploring yourself and your surroundings with patience and acceptance, whatever you find. At some point it occurred to me that I needed to accept how I was feeling instead of fighting it and embrace it instead of running from it.

This was my turning point. Bashing my head against problems was only digging myself a deeper hole, patience and acceptance were the way out. It's simple but simple doesn't mean easy. This whole time I was practicing behaviours that got me to this point and apparently I got pretty good at it! Learning how to change that behaviour was going to take time.

Doing anything when I was fried was ridiculously difficult but learning new skills like patience and acceptance was even more so. I needed to focus on prevention rather than recovery. After a few days I started to feel better again so I started practicing with a focus on patience and acceptance. And I continued to fail but I was also starting to understand.

I noticed that I could spiral out of control really quickly. One problem led to another and they would avalanche on top of me. But I also noticed that there were warning signs in my practices. If my thoughts were racing or I was feeling antsy or agitated then that meant I was potentially carrying some stress. Even more so if it happened in consecutive practices. 

If I noticed warning signs then I tried to be more patient with myself and allocate more downtime and practice. It was really difficult because the warning signs can be subtle and you can't control everything that happens. I seemed to have bad weeks every second week and the lows never got any easier but each time it passed I started to feel a bit more hopeful.

I remember going out for dinner with friends and coming home feeling a bit down. I started going down my habitual path of "Why am I feeling down? What's wrong with me?" and I started to feel a bit upset. But then, all of a sudden, I felt a massive sense of joy and relief. I had just caught myself before a spiral and knew exactly what I needed to do about it. Be patient and accept it.

Lo and behold I eventually felt good for 2 weeks in a row for the first time in months.

I still occasionally have bad weeks and sometimes I don't handle them as well as I could but I'm ok with that I give myself the time and care I need to manage them when they do happen.

## Burnout and Stress

It's now clear to me that I was burnt out - my brain associated effort with failure, making everything seem incredibly difficult. Recovery takes time and means cycling through burnout symptoms like I did. It's commonly associated with long work hours but I now know that's not necessarily the case. I won't go into too much detail about what burnout is here but [Emotional resiliene and burnout in leadership](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FfZ86PGA_uSFf425EzKXAmiFQLFBPqjqPN7iu1TZRw/edit?usp=sharing) from [resilient.wiki](https://resilient.wiki/) is a good place to start.

I think burnout is more to do with stress than work hours. I wasn't working long hours but I was certainly stressed and, as a result, I learned a lot about it and my relationship with it. In hinsight, I would say I'm no stranger to stress and it's actually been a big part of my career. Why? Because I think it's really productive. If I've got tasks that my team genuinely needs me to do today, then I'll write them in a list, complete one after the other and I'll push myself to make sure they're all done. I've worked for hours on end with little more than a 5 minute break and I think stress is a big part of that. Stress blocks out distractions so you can focus on tasks with urgency.

And it's addictive; it feels good to push yourself and get results. I've been doing it for years and I pride myself on my productivity, it's part of my identity. I wasn't fully aware I was even doing it because it's never been a problem. So, what changed? I found myself in a losing situation where I couldn't possibly succeed. The smart thing to do would be to accept that and move on but I couldn't seem to do that. I kept pushing, I kept getting burned and I kept failing. Even when I was defeated I would leave it for a day only to find myself thinking about it all over again.

At some point it affected my sleep, which affected my judgement, which led to more failure, more stress, less sleep and the cycle continues. I didn't even know why I couldn't sleep at the time because I wasn't even consciously aware of my stress because I was so conditioned to it. I remember thinking, "All I need to do is get a good night sleep", as if that would solve all my problems. So I focused on that and beat myself up when it didn't happen even though I was doomed to fail with an attitude like that. Unfortunately being tired also means falling back into these old habits, because it's easier than figuring out new ones. Unfortunately that meant falling back into the same habits that were affecting my sleep and making me tired. Another loop.

It all sounds so silly to think back on now but at the time I found it extremely difficult to see things any other way. That's because stress is all about focussing on something urgent and blocking out everything else. Unfortunately, that also means it's easy to lose perspective. Failure means you're a failure because you're blind to anything that says otherwise. 

That tunnel vision can leave you feeling isolated, even when surrounded by loved ones. When you're suffering in this state it's similar to being in pain so you tend to become self-absorbed and it's hard to be empathetic towards others. I never thought about killing myself but I think I have a better understanding of how someone might get to that point.

## Why does Mindfulness help?

I think mindfulness helps because you practice the skills that counteract the effects of stress.

- **Patience** - Take your time instead of urgently rushing.
- **Acceptance** - Accept things instead of comparing and critiquing them.
- **Think openly** - Think openly instead of getting tunnel vision on goals.

When you practice these skills you learn to appreciate what's around you instead of ignoring it to focus on some idea that only exists inside your head.

Mindfulness, and other stress management strategies, only work if you practice regularly before you're stressed because it's too difficult to learn something new when you're in that state. Even with practice, it'll be challenging but I believe it's a worthwhile endeavour. 

## Writing

Practicing Mindfulness has helped me tremendously in writing this article. I've never been very good at longer forms of writing and it can make me really anxious. I used to write a sentence, read it back, criticise it and rewrite it then repeat until I get annoyed at myself for not making any progress and I still have a tendency to do that now at times. It takes patience to keep writing, even if it doesn't make any sense, and eventually I'll find some words I like. It's probably taken over 100 hours of writing to get to this point which I certainly couldn't manage before.

## Do what works for you

Mindfulness is a personal journey so it's important to explore what works for you.

I've experimented a bit and found all the 3 parts are important for me. I've also found that each one compliments the others so I prefer to do them together.

### Other Ideas

  - [90-90 stretch](https://youtu.be/8p6FtlqpAYg?t=184).
  - [Shoulder rolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVXK4DUoSj8).
  - [Full Sun Salute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73sjOu0g58M).

I do a few exercises before meditation while lying down. I roll my back, stretch my groins and do some hip exercises.

You can practice mindfulness during almost any activity like making tea for example or even eating things like nuts. Maybe you don't need your phone when you go to the toilet.

## Other Good Things

These practices expose you to some other good things outside of mindfulness.

- Time away from a screen.
- Quiet time.
- Nature time.
- Alone time.
- Walking is good exercise.
- Stretching can help with mobility, stiffness and pain. There's also a theory that stress manifests itself in your body, rather than your brain, so stretching may directly relieve some stress.
