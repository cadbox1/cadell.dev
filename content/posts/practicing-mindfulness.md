title: Practicing Mindfulness

I started Practicing Mindfulness regularly in mid-2020 but I didn't realise the impact it would have on me. I originally planned to practice for a week but it's now 2021 and I've been practicing ever since and after hundreds of hours has become an important part of my life.

Each practice consists of:

- Meditation.
- Yoga.
- Walking.

And each practice teaches me about:

- Patience.
- Acceptance.
- Space.

Practicing Mindfulness has been a uniquely weird and interesting experience but it's been really positive for me. I also believe Mindfulness is a personal experience so I'll explain how to practice first and talk more about my experience later.

## First Practice

Allocate an hour but it will probably take less than that.

- Meditation
  - Lie on your back with your eyes closed.
  - Set a timer for 10 minutes.
  - Stay lying down for slightly longer than you feel comfortable with. Aim for about 5 mins.
- Yoga
  - Half Sun Salute
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFkC5HLpfFY
    - Do about 3.
    - Aim for a gentle stretch.
  - Child's pose into Cobra
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerlEPvo5es
    - Do about 3.
    - Aim for a gentle stretch.
- Walking
  - Preferably around nature.
  - Around 1-2km
  - Walk slowly.

There's not many instructions here but this will give you a good introduction to Mindfulness. There's not many details and the mediation is unguided and that's purposely done so you're free to explore. There's no right or wrong way to do it, we're simply creating a space for ourselves and doing so with patience and acceptance. Practicing is far more important than how you practice.

I strongly recommend trying this first practice before reading further.

## Second Practice

This second practice is similar to the first but we're also going to bring attention to our senses.

Allocate an hour but it will probably take less than that.

- Meditation
  - Lie on the floor with your eyes closed.
  - Let your body settle for about a minute or so.
  - Gently start to notice your breath. Notice how air enters and leaves your body. Notice how your diaphragm expands and collapses and what that feels like. Can you feel your breath affect any other parts of your body?
  - It's important to do this with patience and acceptance. If you find it difficult to notice your breath or your body then practice being patient and accept that. Continue to breathe.
  - If you find yourself thinking about something else then, when you're ready, gently bring your attention back to your breath. This is part of the practice and certainly not a problem.
  - As you lie on the floor, notice what the ground feels like underneath you. Is there more pressure in some parts more than others? Have any sensations changed since you've been lying down? Slowly explore the sensations in your body.
  - Again, gently bring attention back to your breath at any time.
  - Allow your body to relax against the floor if it wants to.
  - Stay lying down for slightly longer than what feels comfortable.
- Yoga
  - Do the same exercises as the first practice.
  - Explore the sensations in your body as you stretch. Do they change as you stretch?
  - Go slow, especially the transitions between positions.
  - Gently bring attention back to your breath at any time.
- Walking
  - Explore the weather, the trees, your surroundings or how your muscles feel during your walk.
  - Periodically bring your attention back to your breath.

Throughout each exercise we're bringing attention to our senses but doing so with patience and acceptance, slowly and gently. We also periodically bring attention back to our breath.

Again, there's no right or wrong way to do it; just practice.

I strongly recommend trying this second practice before reading further.

## First Week

The first week is about practicing regularly and exploring further. Explore your senses, surroundings and yourself and do so with patience and acceptance.

- 2 practices per day, one in the morning then again in the evening or at night.
- 5 days, Monday-Friday.

That's about 10 hours in total.

I think this is a good frequency to get started with because each session flows on from the last.

If you found the previous 2 practices interesting, challenging or weird then I strongly recommend a week of practice before reading further.

## What is Mindfulness?

For me, Mindfulness is about exploring with patience and acceptance. You can explore your senses, your surroundings and even yourself. Practicing Mindfulness means giving yourself space to think openly and explore with patience and acceptance.

Each practice is about:

- Going yourself space to think openly.
- Exploring your senses, surroundings and yourself.
- Practicing patience and acceptance.

When you give yourself space and slow down, you're opening yourself up to quieter things happening around you. It's an invitation for sensations, feelings and thoughts and exploring them can be surprisingly immersive and insightful. I've found it incredibly humbling to discover little things happening around me that I didn't notice before, like how a rain drop dances from leaf to leaf as it lands on a plant. If you regularly open yourself up and explore what's around you then your perspective of what's around you can change and that can be really powerful.

Each part of practice is going to invite you to explore slightly different things. In Yoga, we're exploring our bodies, how they move and what that feels like. Meditation is the quietest activity so you might explore your breath or the sensations of the earth supporting your body as you lie on the floor. Over time, Meditation can also be a platform to deploy explore things; sensations, sounds, feelings or thoughts. Walking is more active with lot's of things to explore. You might notice birds singing, fresh air on your face, how the morning light shines on trees or even the sensations of walking in your body. I think walking can be a bridge to bring Mindfulness into the rest of your day. You can practice while waiting for something or while doing something more active like making a cup of tea. You might notice the sound of the water entering the cup, the steam that comes off it, how the cup warms your hands or how the tea tastes on your tongue.

Your intention during practice is also important. We're practicing exploring openly with patience and acceptance which means accepting whatever comes to you and being patient if nothing seems to be coming to you. We're not trying to reach a certain state, like being relaxed or more present, we're simply exploring. Sometimes I find myself sinking into the floor during meditation and other other times I can't hear anything but my thoughts but both are important. Practicing is about a journey, not a destination or, in other words, practice for the sake of practice. That's why I recommend practicing for yourself first so you've got an open mind with less preconceived ideas.

## My Learning Experience

Earlier this year I was feeling pretty shit. I wasn't sleeping well, I was tired and I felt like I was failing at everything. I hated how I was feeling so I was determined to fix it. I swallowed down that feeling of failure and desperately tried to fix the problems I thought we're making me feel like this. I thought I would be ok if I could just make them go away.

And I failed again, and again, and again.

After a while, I started to feel a bit hopeless. I still had a mountain of problems to fix and the ones I had fixed didn't make me feel any better. To make things worse, I was now too exhausted to try anything else. I was fried.

I started practicing Mindfulness a bit before this because I remember practices where I felt peaceful and relaxed, but that wasn't happening anymore. I sat in the park feeling tired and frustrated listening to my loud, rapid thoughts when just a few days before I was admiring the trees in the early morning sun. I just couldn't see that anymore. I felt numb and that beautiful memory felt so far away; it felt like months ago not days. It was like I was inside a hole - I was in the same location but completely blind to my surroundings. I was acutely aware of the hole I was in, I just had no idea how to get out or even the energy to get out or figure it out. I was stuck.

After a few days I started to feel a bit better but it didn't last and I was right in the the same state a week later. It was painful to start feeling better only to have a total regression in such a short amount of time. It was yet another failure and it felt like the worst yet.

At this point, Mindfulness was really frustrating. I was practicing for 10 hours a week and had nothing to show for it. In hindsight, I was still in the early days of learning Mindfulness. It's not about achieving something or feeling a particular way, it's about exploring with patience and acceptance, whatever you find. At some point it occurred to me that I needed to accept how I was feeling instead of fighting it, embrace it instead of running from it. This was my turning point. Bashing my way through 'problems' was only digging myself a deeper hole, patience and acceptance were the way out. It's simple but simple doesn't mean easy.

Doing anything when I was completely fried seemed ridiculously difficult. Practicing new skills like patience and acceptance and unlearning old habits was even harder. I needed to focus on prevention rather than recovery. That meant riding out feeling shit for a few days, then really practicing patience and acceptance when I started to feel better again. Naturally, I fell back into that low state but for the first time I felt like I was starting to understand it more.

I noticed that I things could spiral out of control really quickly. One problem led to another which led to another and they would all avalanche on top of me but I also started to notice some warning signs in my practices. If my thoughts were racing or I felt agitated or even antsy then that could mean I was feeling stressed, even more so if it happened in consecutive practices. It was really difficult because the warning signs were subtle. I was just so unaware of my stress before, probably because I was so used to it. If I noticed any warning signs then I tried to be even more patient with myself and allocate more time for practice and downtime.

I still seemed to have a bad week every second week but each time it passed I started to feel a bit more hopeful. I just needed more practice. I remember going out for dinner with friends and coming home feeling a bit down. It was weird because it was nice evening so I started going down my habitual path of "Why am I feeling down? What's wrong with me?" and I started to feel a bit upset. But then, all of a sudden, I felt a massive sense of relief and joy. I just caught myself right before a downward spiral and knew exactly what I needed to do about it. Be patient with myself and accept it.

Finally, after a few months, I eventually felt good for 2 weeks in a row. I still have bad weeks occasionally and sometimes I don't handle them as well as I probably could but I'm ok with that. When they do happen, I practice giving myself the time and care that I need to manage it.

## Burnout

I've done a lot of reflection since my low point in 2020 and I'm pretty sure I was burnt out - my brain associated effort with failure. Recovery takes time where you'll cycle through symptoms like I did. It's commonly associated with long work hours, which I wasn't doing, but apparently it's more to do with stress and recovery. I won't go into too much detail about what burnout is here but [Emotional resiliene and burnout in leadership](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18FfZ86PGA_uSFf425EzKXAmiFQLFBPqjqPN7iu1TZRw/edit?usp=sharing) from [resilient.wiki](https://resilient.wiki/) is a good place to start.

Stress has been a big part of my career even and I don't think I was fully aware of that before. I find it really productive because I can block out distractions and focus. I write my tasks in a list, complete them one by one and I'll push myself to get as many done as possible. And I enjoyed it because I enjoyed feeling productive and getting recognition for it, it was part of my identity.

The problems started when I found myself in a losing situation where there was no way to win. The smart thing to do would be to try a few times then accept that and move on but I just couldn't seem to do that. I'd keep pushing, keep getting burned and keep failing. Even when I lost I would leave it for a day only to find myself thinking about it all over again. I just felt like such a failure.

At some point it affected my sleep, which affected my judgement, which led to more failure, more stress, less sleep and the cycle continued. I didn't even know why I couldn't sleep at the time. I wasn't aware of how stressed I was because I was so conditioned to it. I remember thinking "All I need to do is get a good night sleep" which, ironically, makes it really hard to sleep. Being tired also meant running on autopilot and falling back into old habits, the same ones that were keeping me awake at night.

It all sounds so silly to think back on now but at the time I couldn't see things any other way. In hindsight, it's not that surprising because that's how stress works. It makes you focus on something urgent but unfortunately that can give you tunnel vision and leave you blind to your surroundings. It can make you feel like a failure when you're surrounded by success and make you feel isolated despite being surrounded by loved ones. It makes it very difficult to connect with anything or anyone. I never thought about killing myself but I feel like I now have a better understanding of how someone might get to that point.

## Perspective

When I was burnt out, I had a bleak perspective. I was tired, stressed and everything felt incredibly difficult. I felt like I had to act urgently to fix whatever was making me feel this way. Practicing Mindfulness helped me immensely, not by fixing my problems, by offering me a new perspective. It taught me how to be more patient and to explore my surroundings and myself and when I practiced it more the things that were stressing me out didn't seem so important anymore.

Patience and acceptance directly oppose the effects of stress. When you accept your current state, you don't feel the need to act urgently to change things but building that acceptance takes practice and patience. If you're not where you want to be, that's okay and being unhappy is okay as well. In my experience, it's going to be much worse if you spend your time denying and rejecting how you feel. At some point, I accepted that I was pretty messed up and it was strangely comforting. Then can you start exploring how you feel and begin understanding yourself and your situation. There's no silver bullet or quick fix.

It's simple but it can be incredibly difficult. I think that's partly because a large part of our society is based around consumption and technology amplifies it. It puts consumption at your fingertips and it's satisfying that it's addictive to the point where can easily spend every spare second you have consuming media. And why wouldn't you? It's fun. Who wouldn't want to get more fun into their day?

Sometimes you can't see the forest from the trees. Practicing Mindfulness means spending a long time exploring small things for almost no reason. It seems pointless but that's almost the point - doing pointless things can open you up to new ideas and perspectives. This is what's known as practicing a "beginner's mind", practicing being a student instead of a teacher by exploring openly with minimal expectations. It can be incredibly humbling. That also means we don't skip practices because we've found something better to do. We practice for the sake of practice in a steady rhythm that flows from one practice to the next.

Exploring openly builds awareness. When you lie down to meditate you're becoming aware of your headspace, when you stretch in yoga you become aware of your body and when you go for a walk around the park you become aware of your surroundings. It's simple but it's also powerful with enough practice. It helps break away from the tunnel vision that stress can give you and when you do that the things that were causing you stress just don't seem that important anymore.

Body awareness has been particularly interesting for me. It's seems obvious in hindsight but but I learned a lot about the intimate connection between our minds and our bodies. Stress is associated with tight muscles, changes in digestion and sensitivity to light and I've even read that we that we might actually feel stress through these changes in our bodies instead of the other way around. That means stretching, moving and building awareness of our body might have a direct effect on our mood. Regardless of causality, I think body awareness is an important part of Mindfulness. When I couldn't sleep, I actually got annoyed at my body because it wasn't doing what I wanted it to do. Now I realise my body was actually getting annoyed at me because I wasn't giving it what it needed. We're a team.

Exploring your body can go really deep. A handful of times I've fallen into something I can only describe as some sort of a trance while meditating. It's like my body has fallen asleep but I'm still awake. It feels like I've fallen through the floor and I can feel a lot all these little sensations in different parts of my body all simultaneously. It's not particularly enjoyable but it's so weird and interesting that I naturally want to stay. When I come out of it I wonder where I've just been. It's like going on a strange journey without going anywhere and when it's over I just feel refreshed, like I've just had a nap. It might be hard to grasp at first but if you spend enough time opening up there's no telling what you might find.

One night, I walked around my park and started exploring my surroundings. I heard the sound of crickets to my left, the rustle of tree leaves above me and felt a warm breeze on my face. I felt lucky to be there experiencing it all. Then I realised there must be an infinite amount of detail around me that I'm completely unaware of and if I'm patient and explore openly then some of those details might reveal themselves to me. I felt humbled and content and it gave me a strange sense of purpose and peace.

It's nice to think that we're always moving through time, even when we're sitting still. It's moving around us, delivering sensations and experiences and connecting everyone and everything together. "Spending time" seems like such a silly phrase, it's not ours to spend. I think about my family and friends and the trees and the birds in the park and I wish them all the best with whatever they're doing with each moment. I'm not very spiritual but I can't help but think there's something spiritual about wishing for the best from something external.

When I practice, I often find myself thinking about my grandparents who have passed. Sometimes it can be quite emotional and I've shied away from those emotions in the past but now I try to embrace them with patience and acceptance. If it gets too much, I bring my attention back to my breath then continue exploring when I'm ready. Sometimes I've felt like they've been right there with me as I walk around the park. That's not so hard to understand when you realise how much of an impact loved ones can have on you. They're a part of who you are. If you open yourself up, they might not feel so far away.

Practicing Mindfulness has been a uniquely interesting experience. It's certainly changed my perspective and how I think about things and that's because I've explored and experienced things I never had before. I feel like I have a better understanding of myself, my body and what's around me as a result. I used to strive for success and happiness but I now think they're rather short sighted, they're fickle and short lived. I now strive for balance - achieve all that I can while exploring openly. Every day is practice.

## Experiment

Mindfulness is a personal journey so it's important to explore what works for you. Here's some ideas:

- Listen to music while meditating or see if you can mediate while someone is watching TV (challenging).
- Stretch your groins, do some hip thrusts or the [90-90 stretch](https://youtu.be/8p6FtlqpAYg?t=184) for hip mobility.
- Practice mindfulness when you eat things like nuts or drink something like tea or soda water.
- Find a schedule that works for you. I personally like first thing in the morning and then straight after work but I've also enjoyed practicing at night, particularly walking around my park at night.
- Watching birds, plants, trees and nature while sitting cross legged or watch the sky while lying on your back.
- Practice after a workout or a run.
- Practicing while waiting for something or someone.
- Practicing when you feel tired, instead of having a nap.

## Writing

This is the first essay I've written since high school and those were pretty awful. I've always found longer forms of writing difficult, even more so for a topic as personal as this. Mindfulness has been not only the inspiration for this essay but also the method - it's taken hundreds of hours over many months and lots of patience and acceptance. It's tested me immensely but I'm glad I could put some of my experiences into words even if it's just for my future self.

I'll fill this in later.
