# Cadell.dev

Generated with [gatsby-start-blog-theme](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme).

Which uses:

- [gatsby-theme-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog)
  - which uses [gatsby-theme-blog-core](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog-core) which is well supported and handles MDX and GraphQL queries for a blog.
- [Theme-UI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/theme-ui/)

I ended up overriding a lot of files with shadowing so it might be better to use gatsby-theme-blog-core directly in future.
